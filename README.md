# Intelligent Navigation of Text-Based Games


## Generating Games

To generate a game, run a command matching the following format:

`tw-make.py twcc_(easy|medium|hard)_level(\d+)_gamesize(\d+)_step(\d+)_seed(\d+)_(train|validation|test)`

where:
- `mode` is easy if there are no distractor nodes and hard if there are a lot.
- `level` is the number of steps needed to solve each map.
- `gamesize` is the number of maps.
- `step` is ???.
- `seed` is the random seed.
- `split` determines which group of data these maps belong to.

Then edit the `game_folder` variable in file `test_game.py` to point to the new game folder (which can likely be found in the `gen_games` folder). Note that the `gen_games` folder already contains games of all three modes for levels 1-3, where each game contains 10 maps.


## Selecting an Agent

To select an agent, edit the `agent` variable in file `test_game.py`. Import the agent, if is not already imported.

So far, the following agents exist:
- `RandomAgent` selects actions randomly, ignoring text generated by the game.
- `Agent01` is a work in progress, which currently acts the same as `RandomAgent` but passes text through an LSTM layer.


## Testing the Agent

To test the agent, run `python 3 test_game.py`.
